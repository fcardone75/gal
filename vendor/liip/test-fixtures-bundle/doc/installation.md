Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

## 2. Enable the Bundle only in the test environment

 return [
-    Liip\TestFixturesBundle\LiipTestFixturesBundle::class => ['dev' => true, 'test' => true],
+    Liip\TestFixturesBundle\LiipTestFixturesBundle::class => ['test' => true],
 ];
```
